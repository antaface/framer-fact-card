# 🧠 Framer Fact Card

A code component for Framer that displays a random science, nature, or space fact — pulled from a Notion database using a Vercel-hosted API.

Built entirely by a designer (not a dev) who wanted to make something fun, weird, and knowledgey for the footer of her website.

## 🌐 Demo
→ antarabasu.com --> Navigate to the footer!  
→ Substack walkthrough – coming soon

## 🚀 How It Works

- The API is hosted on Vercel and fetches a random fact from a Notion database
- The Framer code component fetches that fact and displays it with animation
- A refresh link lets you load another one without reloading the page
- Customisable for all breakpoints
